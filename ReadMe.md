# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This Weather Dashboard is a web app allowing users to retrieve/display weather information for a specific locationâ€” either by entering a zip code or city name, users can obtain the current weather conditions, including: temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. A 5-day forecast is also provided, because of course most people will be around somewhere for more than a day. The application fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API, which reliably presents weather data.


## Usage
To use the Weather Dashboard, follow these instructions:
1. Open the Weather Dashboard in your browser, using [this address](https://will-riffe.github.io/prsnl-weather-app/)

3. Press Enter or click the search button to retrieve the weather information.
4. The current weather conditions, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed, will be displayed.
5. A 5-day forecast will also be shown, providing insights into future weather trends.

## Attribution
It took me a while to re-adjust to this project, and it was made much easier by referencing my classmate, [Muhammad Moghul's](https://github.com/mmoghal/weather-dashboard/blob/main/assets/scripts/script.js#L41) work on the same project. There are some lines of code, such as checking the zip code through regex, which come straight from his code; otherwise I mostly used it as inspiration or a kind of "checklist".
